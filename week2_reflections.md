Things I learned this week:

Polymorphism: many forms
function: isintance 
compile time polymorphism obviously python cannot do because it's an intrepreted language

Recursion:
A function that calls itself

Python allows recursion as it can be useful but it also has its own limitations

Used to break down complex probelms and turned into simple subproblems, making solving problems easier

Helps us by forcing us to understand the call stack: a data structure in a computer that mangaes what our computers are able to do. 

Increases **Efficiency**

Any recursive program can be changed to an iterative program



def F1():
  print ("n")
  F1
