Things I learned this week:

Polymorphism: many forms
function: isintance 
compile time polymorphism obviously python cannot do because it's an intrepreted language

Recursion:
A function that calls itself

Python allows recursion as it can be useful but it also has its own limitations

def F1():
  print ("n")
  F1
