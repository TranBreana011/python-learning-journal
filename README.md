A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me: A freshman at West Valley College attempting to expand my abilties of computer science. 
I'm willing and determined to understand and master core concepts even if it takes me a while. 
Not the fastest programmer nor the most strategic but I'm trying my best! :D


Goals for This Course: Gain more knowlegde on python and its versaility such as its specific and unique functions.
I want to end this course with a solid and foundational base of Python that leaves me confident in working
through this language when needed.


My First Python Program 
```python
print ("Hello World!")
```
