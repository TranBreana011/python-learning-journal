Week 3:

Algorithm Runtime Complexity:

1. Space/Storage, space can grow exponentially

2. Time

3. Cost (API)

Constant Time Operations O(1)
- math, = (assignment), comparison, [] = index for arrays
- python doesn't have fixed sizes

  Growth of Functions and Complexity
  - as the size of input data increases, the behavior of algorithms change

Upper bound = worst case scenario
Lower bound = best case scenario

We care more about upper bounds/worst case scenarios because there's nothing to fix about best case scenarios

Upper bounds may take more time and space

Big O Notation
- provides a standardized way to describe the upper bound/worst case runtime complexity of an algorithm

Our goal is to see how functions will scale with size, allowing us to analyze algorithms independent of the hardware or implementation
